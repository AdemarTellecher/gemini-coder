# Any Model FIM

## Description
Any Model FIM let's you use any model as a Fill-in-the-middle coding assistant.

Use the most powerful AI in a cost-effective manner with context automatically filled with all your opened tabs.

Set up a keybinding for the command: "Any Model FIM: Run" and enjoy the most intelligent responses you can get.

Use the command "Any Model FIM: Insert <FIM></FIM> tokens" to provide detailed instructions for the intended filling between <FIM></FIM>, then run as always.

For each provider, you can set multiple API keys, divided by commas, and the extension will randomly choose one for each request, helping you avoid rate limits.
