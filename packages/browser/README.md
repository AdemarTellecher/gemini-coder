# Gemini Coder Connector

This browser extension is a simple, single purpose content script that automatically initializes chats in AI Studio and DeepSeek with prompts generated by the VS Code extension.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-coder-connector/ljookipcanaglfaocjbgdicfbdhhjffp) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gemini-coder-connector/).
2. Open the Gemini Coder VS Code extension.
3. Open the Context View -> Chat panel.
4. Enter your instruction and continue in the browser.

## How it works

Prompt is passed via clipboard, the extension reads it and manages basic web interactions for chat initialization. Once chat is initialized, the injected content script is done with all its work.
