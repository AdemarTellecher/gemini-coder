  <summary>**Narrow permissions**</summary>

The extension needs only these basic permissions:

**Access to specific websites** <br/>
The extension injects [a content script](https://github.com/robertpiosik/gemini-coder/blob/master/packages/browser/src/content-scripts/send-prompt-content-script.ts) for chat initialization in supported chatbots:

- https://gemini.google.com/app
- https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat
- https://chatgpt.com/
- https://chat.deepseek.com/
- https://github.com/copilot
- https://claude.ai/new
- https://chat.mistral.ai/chat
- https://grok.com/
- https://huggingface.co/chat/
- http://openwebui/

**Storage permission** <br/> Used to temporarily store context and prompt for context script to use.

**Alarms permission** <br/> Used for maintaining a stable WebSocket connection with the VS Code extension (Chrome only).

The connector is completely open source, with all code available in the <a href="https://github.com/robertpiosik/gemini-coder/tree/master/packages/browser" target="_blank">repository</a>.

  <summary>**How it works?**</summary>
The browser connector maintains a persistent WebSocket connection with your VS Code instance, enabling real-time communication between the two:

1. **Connection establishment**: The extension automatically attempts to connect to the local WebSocket server running in VS Code managed process on port `55155`.
2. **Secure communication**: The connection uses security tokens to validate and authenticate communication between your browser and VS Code.
3. **Automatic reconnection**: Whenever you reopen the editor, the connection is up instantly.

When you select context, write instruction and submit, the extension receives message and automatically opens a new tab with your selected chatbot, inserting your context and prompt hands-free.
