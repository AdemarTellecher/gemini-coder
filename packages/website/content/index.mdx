## Take charge of the context

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong or at a high cost in token usage and speed. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You decide** which files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of code patterns to include
- **You determine** how much context to send
- **You see** exactly how many tokens you're sending

The result? More accurate responses, fewer hallucinations, and better alignment with your team's coding practices.

## Features

- Use <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank">your own API key</a> with built-in Gemini models for FIM completions, file refactoring or applying AI suggested changes to a file.
- Configurable with additional OpenAI API compatible AI providers of your choice.
- Effectively replaces the default Explorer view with context selectable file tree.
- Forwards your chat prompts to the browser for superior Web experience (tabs, public sharing, canvas, etc.). Supported web chats:
  - AI Studio
  - Gemini
  - ChatGPT
  - Claude
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Grok

  <summary>Can I use X with Nextra?</summary>
The answer is "yes" for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

  <summary>How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?</summary>
There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
[react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
add live coding components to your MDX.
