# Apply changes

The feature helps you integrate AI-suggested changes to your codebase with a single click. Copy the AI's response (or just a single file block) to your clipboard, then return to VS Code and click the "Apply changes" button in the status bar (or use the corresponding command).

Full responses to be parsed correctly, code blocks should be formatted in one of two variants:

<Tabs groupId="apply-changes-format">
  <TabItem value="format" label='"name" attribute'>

````markdown
```typescript name=path/to/your/file.ts
// Code content for the file goes here...
```
````

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="comment" label="First line comment">

````markdown
```typescript
// path/to/your/file.ts
// Code content for the file goes here...
```
````

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How it Works

- If you copied updates for a single file, make sure its original version is currently seen (active editor)
- If you copied whole response, this is what happens:
  - text surrounding code blocks is discarded
  - you'll be prompted to choose between **Intelligent update** (uses AI to merge partial changes) and **Fast replace** (directly replaces file content, assuming clipboard has full files).
    - **Intelligent update**: For each file block found, the AI uses the existing file content and the provided block content (treated as instructions/diff) to generate the fully updated file. If a file doesn't exist, it will be created (after confirmation).
    - **Fast replace**: For each file block found, the content is used to either overwrite an existing file or create a new one (after confirmation). This mode is instantaneous but assumes the clipboard contains the complete, final content for each file.
  - In both modes, you get an option to **Revert** the changes immediately after they are applied.

_Structure of the generated message:_

```
<file>...</file>
User requested refactor of a file. In your response send fully updated <file> only, without explanations or any other text.
[Clipboard-stored instructions]
```

## Available commands

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes`

Applies changes to the current file using the default model.

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes with...`

Lets you select which model to use for applying changes.

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes to Clipboard`

Instead of applying changes directly with API, copies the apply changes prompt to your clipboard for use in other tools.

##### `Gemini Coder: Change Default Apply Changes Model`

Configure which model should be used as the default for applying changes.
