# Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM)

Gemini Coder's FIM feature enables you inserting AI generated code completions directly at cursor's position while using the selected context. This feature uses frontier models, much bigger than those in other tools' "tab completion" features and is designed for on-demand use. We observe that the trade-off between speed and accuracy of this approach is worth the increase in latency.

_Structure of the generated message:_

<Tabs groupId="fim-message-structure">
  <TabItem value="api" label="API">

```
<files>
  [CONTEXT]
  <file name="...">
    ...
    <fill missing code>
    ...
  </file>
</files>
Somewhere in files you encountered the <fill missing code> symbol. Send the missing code only, without explanations, or any other text.
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="chat" label="CHAT">

Chat instruction asks for reasoning behind the decision about completion.

```
<files>
  [CONTEXT]
  <file name="...">
    ...
    <fill missing code>
    ...
  </file>
</files>
Somewhere in files you encountered the <fill missing code> symbol. Send the missing code and explain your reasoning.
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
