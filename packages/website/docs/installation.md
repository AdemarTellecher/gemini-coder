# Installation

Gemini Coder has two components - a VS Code extension and a browser connector faciliating hands-free chat initialization.

## VS Code Extension

To install [Gemini Coder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertpiosik.gemini-coder), follow these steps:

1.  **Open Visual Studio Code**: Launch the VS Code editor.
2.  **Open Extensions View**: Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
3.  **Search for Gemini Coder**: In the Extensions view search box, type "Gemini Coder".
4.  **Install the Extension**: Find "Gemini Coder - the 2M context AI coding assistant" by Robert Piosik and click the "Install" button.

Once installed, the Gemini Coder icon will appear in the Activity Bar, providing access to the extension's features.
