# Introduction

Gemini coder is an all-in-one, universal, free and open-source AI coding assistant with first class support for AI Studio and Gemini API.

Granularly pick context and initalize chats in the web browser, hands-free! Use the same context using API with Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) completions and file refactoring. Use Apply Changes feature to integrate AI suggested modifications to a file with a single click!

## Own the context

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong or at a high cost in token usage and latency. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You select** which folders/files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of coding conventions to include
- **You know** how much tokens is used with API calls and web chats at any moment

The result? Accurate, fast and cheap responses.

## Features

- Use [your own API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) with built-in Gemini models for FIM completions, file refactoring and applying AI suggested changes to a file.
- Configurable with additional OpenAI API compatible AI providers of your choice.
