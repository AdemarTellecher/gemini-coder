## You own the context

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You select** which folders and files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of coding conventions to include
- **You know** how much tokens are used in web chats and code completion/file refactoring requests

The result? Unmatched in accuracy, speed and cost AI assistance.

> Too many tokens fighting for attention may _decrease_ performance due to being too "distracting", diffusing attention too broadly and decreasing a signal to noise ratio in the features. ~Andrej Karpathy
