# Introduction

The extension lets you granularly pick context and initalize chats in the web browser, hands-free! Use the same context using powerful API features: Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) completions and file refactoring. To integrate AI suggested modifications to any file with a single click, copy them and hit _Apply changes_ âœ¨.

- Free and open source
- No usage tracking
- Lightweight (~1MB)
- Works with all VS Code based editors (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, etc.)

## You own the context

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You select** which folders/files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of coding conventions to include
- **You know** how much tokens is used with API calls and web chats at any moment

The result? Unmatched in accuracy, speed and cost AI assistance.
