# Introduction

The extension lets you granularly pick and copy context or **initalize chats in the web browser**, hands-free! Use the same context using powerful API features: **Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM)** completions and **file refactoring**.

With Gemini Coder you can do all the coding for free!

## You own the context

> Too many tokens fighting for attention may _decrease_ performance due to being too "distracting", diffusing attention too broadly and decreasing a signal to noise ratio in the features. ~Andrej Karpathy

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You select** which folders/files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of coding conventions to include
- **You know** how much tokens is used with API calls and web chats at any moment

The result? Unmatched in accuracy, speed and cost AI assistance.
