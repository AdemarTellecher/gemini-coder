# Privacy

Gemini Coder does not collect any user data.

---

## Core privacy principles

### No data collection

Neither the VS Code extension nor the web browser connector sends any of your code or prompts to any servers.

### Local processing

Context selection and management happens entirely within your local VS Code environment.

### Direct API connections

When using API-based features (Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM), Refactoring or Apply Changes), your selected context and instructions are sent directly to the provider (e.g., Gemini API).

### Browser integration

The web browser connector extension establishes a WebSocket connection between VS Code and itself.
