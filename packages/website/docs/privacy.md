# Privacy

Gemini Coder does not collect any user data.

---

## Core privacy principles

### No data collection

Neither the VS Code extension nor the browser connector sends any of your code or prompts to any servers.

### Local processing

Context selection and management happens entirely within your local VS Code environment.

### Direct API connections

When using API-based features like Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) or Refactoring, your selected context and instructions are sent directly to the API provider you've configured (e.g., Google's Gemini API).

### Browser integration

The browser connector establishes a local WebSocket connection between VS Code and your browser, with no intermediate servers involved.
