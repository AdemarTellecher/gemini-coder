# Privacy

Gemini Coder does not collect any usage data

## Core principles

### No tracking

Gemini Coder does not collect any usage statistics.

### API communication

When using API-based features (FIM completions, File refactoring or Applying changes) your messages are sent directly to the model provider.

### Web browser communication

The VS Code extension manages its own WebSocket server which orchestrates bi-directional message flow between all VS Code processes and the web browser integration.

### Open source

Gemini Coder is open source under the MIT license. This means the entire codebase is publicly available for review and audit. You can verify for yourself that the extension operates as described and adheres to these privacy principles.
