# Applying changes

Gemini Coder's Apply Changes feature helps you implement AI-suggested modifications to your code. When AI tools suggest partial updates to your file (like changing specific sections while preserving others), this feature helps transform those suggestions into a complete updated file.

## How It Works

### Copy AI Suggestions

When an AI suggests changes in chat, copy the output for the given file to your clipboard.

### Open Target File

Make sure the file you want to modify is open and active in the editor.

### Run Command

Execute one of the Apply Changes commands.

### Review Updates

The AI will process the suggestions and generate a complete updated file with all changes properly applied.

## Available Commands

### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes to this File`

Applies changes to the current file using the default model.

### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes to this File with...`

Lets you select which model to use for applying changes.

### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes to Clipboard`

Instead of applying changes directly with API, copies the apply changes prompt to your clipboard for use in other tools.

### `Gemini Coder: Change Default Apply Changes Model`

Configure which model should be used as the default for applying changes.
