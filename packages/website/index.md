## Take charge of the context

Gemini Coder works best for users knowing their codebases - automated context search is unreliable and does not look for valuable examples of your team's conventions.

## Features

- Use <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank">your own API key</a> with built-in Gemini models for FIM completions, file refactoring or applying AI suggested changes to a file.
- Configurable with additional OpenAI API compatible AI providers of your choice.
- Effectively replaces the default Explorer view with context selectable file tree.
- Forwards your chat prompts to the browser for superior Web experience (tabs, public sharing, canvas, etc.). Supported web chats:
  - AI Studio
  - Gemini
  - ChatGPT
  - Claude
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Grok
  - DeepSeek
  - Mistral
  - Open WebUI
