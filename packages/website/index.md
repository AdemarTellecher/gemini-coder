## Take charge of the context

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong or at a high cost in token usage and speed. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You decide** which files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of code patterns to include
- **You determine** how much context to send
- **You see** exactly how many tokens you're sending

The result? More accurate responses, fewer hallucinations, and better alignment with your team's coding practices.

## Features

- Use <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank">your own API key</a> with built-in Gemini models for FIM completions, file refactoring or applying AI suggested changes to a file.
- Configurable with additional OpenAI API compatible AI providers of your choice.
- Effectively replaces the default Explorer view with context selectable file tree.
